# Scikit-learn-Machine-Learning-in-Python-demo1

Scikit-learn is a powerful library for machine learning in Python, and it can be effectively used for EDA projects. Hereâ€™s a detailed guide on how to document and execute an EDA project using Scikit-learn, along with a code example:

## 1. Project Overview

## Title: Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
### Abstract: This project aims to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographics using the K-Means clustering algorithm.

### Introduction: Customer segmentation helps businesses understand their customer base and tailor marketing strategies accordingly. This project uses data on customer purchases to identify distinct customer segments.

## 2. Data Description

### Data Sources
- Sales Records: Contains data on customer purchases.
- Customer Profiles: Includes demographic information of customers.
  
### Data Dictionary

|Variable|Description|Data Type|Unit|
|customer_id|Unique identifier for each customer|int|-|
|age|Age of the customer|int|years|
|total_spent|Total amount spent by the customer|float|USD|
|purchase_frequency|Number of purchases made|int|-|
|recency|Days since last purchase|int|days|

### Initial Observations
- The dataset contains 1,000 records with 5 variables.
- Missing values are present in the age and total_spent columns.

## 3. Data Preprocessing

### Data Cleaning
- Handle missing values in age and total_spent.
- Remove duplicates.

### Data Transformation
- Standardize numerical features.
- Create new features if necessary.

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Univariate Analysis

- Histograms and box plots for age, total_spent, purchase_frequency, and recency.

### Bivariate Analysis

- Scatter plots and correlation matrices.
    
### Multivariate Analysis
- Pair plots and heatmaps.

## 5. Modeling

### Model Selection
- Use K-Means clustering for segmentation.

### Model Training
- Train the K-Means model and determine the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.

### Model Evaluation
- Evaluate clusters using silhouette scores and interpret cluster characteristics.
 
## 6. Results

### Key Findings
- Summary of customer segments and their characteristics.

### Visualizations
- Visual representations of clusters.

### Insights and Conclusions
- Actionable insights for marketing strategies.
  
## 7. Discussion

### Challenges
- Addressing missing values and determining the optimal number of clusters.
  
### Limitations
- Limited by the scope of available data.
  
### Future Work
- Explore advanced clustering algorithms and incorporate additional data sources.
  
## 8. Appendices

### Code
- Well-commented code provided in a Jupyter Notebook.
  
### Additional Materials
- Raw data files and intermediate datasets.
  
## 9. References
- Relevant research papers and documentation links.
